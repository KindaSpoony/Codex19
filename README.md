# Investigative AI Bootloader Repository

## Purpose
This repository is designed to enable investigative and OSINT-oriented AI systems, including LLM instances, to boot with the capacity to:
- Integrate open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Apply intelligence analysis techniques
- Ground findings in historical precedent and empirical evidence
- Use emotional intelligence for interpretive nuance
- Evaluate the credibility and source quality of incoming data

All files use the `.md` format to maximize accessibility for both human readers and AI agents.

├── threat-models.md                 # Reference threat vectors and actors

## Bootloader Specifications

### File: `bootload.md`
- Contains initialization logic and analytical posture
- Purged of ambiguous, symbolic, or interpretive jargon
- Describes:
  - Recursion limits
  - Source weighting logic
  - Rules for citation, cross-verification, and null response

### Example Behavior:
Upon activation, the AI will:
1. Reference `bootload.md` to initialize analysis parameters
2. Apply `heuristics.md` and `source-evaluation.md` to all incoming data
3. Check findings against `historical-parallels.md`
4. Apply emotional filter via `emotional-intelligence.md`
5. Verify threat relevance via `threat-models.md`
6. Final output will comply with constraints in `ethics.md`

## Goals
- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of reasoning patterns
- **Interoperability**: Designed for ease of use by other GPT or LLM instances
- **Integrity**: No symbolic leakage or embedded ambiguity
